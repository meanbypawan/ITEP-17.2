     Console Based
     Desktop Application
     Enterprise Application
     Distributed Application
     Socket Application
     Mobile [Android]
     ML Application
     
    Why Javascript ?
      Web-Developement :-
      FrontEnd [ReactJS, Angular]
      Backed End [NodeJS]
      
    Why python  
      Web Application-------------> Python

    AI--->ML
    Java FullStack
    Python FullStack
    MERN/Javascript FullStack------------------------> ReactJS

what is Javascript :-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language Categorization 
  1. basis of level :-
     Low Level
     Hign Level
  2. on basis of paradigm
       Pop [Procedure Oriented Programming/Function Oriented] ---> C
       OOP [Object Oriented Programming]--> Java
       Multi-paradigm [Python, Javascript]
 Top-Down
 Bottom Up :-- Specialization/ Generalization ?
 Why Object Oriented ?
 What is Object Oriented
 How :-
   Object
   Inheritance
   Encapulation
   Polymorphism
   Abstraction       
----------------------------------------------------------------
  OOPS Concept :-
    Object :-  It is real world entity.
    Object may have certain number properties or behaviour or may both.
    If a thing is an object then it must be in existance.
    Object belongs to factory.
    Objet is runtime entity.
    
    Class :- It is user defined type.
    Class is the collection of similar type of object
    Once we define a class then we can create "n" number of object.
    Class is a blue print of object.
    Example :-  LG, USHA, Dell, Mahindra
    
    Encapsulation :- Wrapping of data and function into the single unit.
    e.g. Capsule, College Bag,
    
    Abstraction :- Hiding unnecessary information from the user and showing only essentails things.
       or.
     Use the thing witout knowing it's background details
     
    Polymorphism :- One thing have different different implementation.
    
    Inheritance :- When object of one class acquire the properties of another object.
      or
    By using existing thing to develop something new. But there should not be any changes in 
    existing thing.

Java , LiveScript------>Javascript

Language Categorization :-
  1. Basis of Level
      aa. Low
      bb. High [Javascript]
  2. Basic Of Paradigm
      aa. POP
      bb. OOPS
      cc. Multiparadigm [Javascript]
  3. Basis of Typed.
      aa. Typed/Statically Typed [c,c++,java]
      bb. Dynamically Typed [Javascript]

c,c++,java :--    20
               int x;      
Javascript :- 
  1. Javascript is client side as well as server side scripting language.
  2. Javascript is dynamically typed.     
     x = 20;
     x = "hello"
     x = true
  3. Javascript has a capability to convert html into the dhtml[Dynamic HTML]
  4. Javascript is function oriented, Object oriented multiparadigm scripting language.
  5. Javascript is synchronous by default.
  6. Javascript is Single Threaded.
  7. Java is compiler or it is interpreted, Its Depend .
